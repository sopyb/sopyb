## üë§ About me:

I'm a self-taught developer from Romania, currently pursuing a degree in Control and Automation Engineering.

Trying my best to build a shell I'd not hate to use.

I love open-source, and I'm passionate about technology, always. I dream of changing the world, one line of code at a time. Contributing as much as I can to projects that I find interesting and useful.

Building random stuff, learning new things, and helping others is what I do best. I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn.
